TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard and PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1 and PixelClk_ClockingWizard are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard]
Related violations: <none>
