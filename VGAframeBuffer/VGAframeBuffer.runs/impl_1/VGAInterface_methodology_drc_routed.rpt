2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard and PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1 and PixelClk_ClockingWizard are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard_1] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell verticalTimings/horizontalTimings/Red_reg[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Blue_reg[3]/CLR, Green_reg[3]/CLR, Red_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Blue_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Blue_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Green_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Green_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Red_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Red_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
