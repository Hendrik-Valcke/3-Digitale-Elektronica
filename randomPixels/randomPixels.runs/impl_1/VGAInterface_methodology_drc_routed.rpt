2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clockmap/inst/SysClk100MHz is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clockmap/inst/SysClk100MHz is created on an inappropriate internal pin clockmap/inst/SysClk100MHz. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell verticalTimings/horizontalTimings/Red_reg[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Blue_reg[3]/CLR, Green_reg[3]/CLR, Red_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ResetN relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Blue_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Blue_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Green_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Green_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Red_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Red_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
